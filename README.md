# My Portfolio

## Overview

This repository is a monorepo that houses my personal portfolio, built using a microfrontend architecture. Each project within the portfolio is treated as a separate microfrontend, with the portfolio itself acting as the overarching macro application. The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my skills and projects using a variety of modern web technologies.

## Architecture

The architecture of this portfolio is designed to be modular and scalable, with each microfrontend handling a specific project or section of the portfolio. The following technologies and tools are utilized:

- **Turborepo:** Manages the monorepo and optimizes build processes across multiple microfrontends.
- **SolidJS:** Used for certain microfrontends to create highly performant and reactive user interfaces.
- **Webpack:** Bundles and optimizes the assets for each microfrontend, ensuring efficient loading and performance.
- **React & Next.js:** Powers the main portfolio application and some microfrontends, providing a robust and dynamic user experience.
- **TypeScript & JavaScript:** TypeScript is used for type safety and maintainability across most of the codebase, while JavaScript is employed where flexibility is needed.
- **Node.js & Flask:** Backend services that support the portfolio's functionality, with Flask handling any API needs and Node.js managing server-side rendering or other backend tasks.
